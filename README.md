# Spotify_ML
An attempt to use machine learning to fit Spotify audio features to Spotify "Popularity" index.

create_data.ipynb creates a csv of Spotify songs for late use (you need your own API key for this). <br>
data_fitting.ipynb is the analysis and machine learning notebook. <br>
XGB_fitting.ipynb is the XGB version of machine learning analysis. <br>

Note: these notebooks were created using the VSCode notebook extension.
There seems to be compatibility between Jupyter Lab and VSCode (relating to the EOL terminators used in both).
